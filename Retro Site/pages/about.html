            <h2>The History of the Gramophone</h2>
            <p>The gramophone, invented by Emile Berliner in the late 19th century, revolutionized the way we listen to
                music.
                Unlike its predecessor, the phonograph, which used cylinders, the gramophone utilized flat discs to
                record and
                play sound. This innovation allowed for easier mass production and distribution of music.</p>
            <p>Gramophones became a staple in households around the world, bringing music into everyday life and paving
                the way
                for modern audio technology. The rich, warm sound produced by gramophones is still cherished by
                audiophiles and
                collectors today.</p>
