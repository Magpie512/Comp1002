<!-- STEP 6: Add an IMG element just before the H1 element below, and point the src attribute to the SVG file called "html-logo.svg" inside the 'images' directory - then have a look at the resulting page in a browser -->
<img src="https://magpie512.github.io/Comp1002/images/html-logo.svg" alt="HTML5 Logo in lego font" height="100" width="100">
<!-- STEP 7: Add an appropriate height and width to the above IMG element - the SVG can be scaled to any size, unlike a bitmap (JPG, PNG, GIF), but keep it square -->
<!-- STEP 8: Add an appropriate alt attribute to the IMG element above, describing the image -->
<!-- STEP 9: Validate your completed page at https://validator.w3.org/ and repair any errors - then .zip all your files up and submit your work -->
<!-- STEP 10: Upload all files for this lab to your Web server in https://YOUR-SERVERNAME-HERE/week5/lab5/ (URL example would be on a Microsoft Azure server instance) -->

					<h4>Latest Research Reveals Building Blocks are Cool</h4>
					<p class="author">by Brick Astley<br /><time datetime="2018-03-29">March 29, 2018</time></p>
					<p>Scientists have spoken: building blocks are officially cool again. Turns out, stacking colorful cubes isn’t just fun—it’s basically brain yoga. Whether you're constructing a castle or just procrastinating creatively, blocks are the unsung heroes of intelligence, imagination, and avoiding actual responsibilities. <a href="#" class="read-more">Read more…</a></p>

					<h4>Building Blocks Aren't Just For Kids</h4>
					<p class="author">by Brick Newton<br /><time datetime="2017-06-17">June 17, 2017</time></p>
					<p>Turns out, building blocks are having a midlife renaissance. Once confined to sticky-fingered toddlers, they’re now the darlings of cognitive science and office icebreakers. Researchers say stacking plastic bricks improves focus, creativity, and your ability to pretend you're being productive. So go ahead—build that tiny fortress. It’s basically self-care. <a href="#" class="read-more">Read more…</a></p>

					<h4>The Aussie Boat That Floats on Blocks</h4>
					<p class="author">by Snap Solo<br /><time datetime="2018-02-15">February 15, 2018</time></p>
					<p>In a stunning display of engineering and stubborn optimism, a team of Australians has built a fully functional boat entirely out of building blocks. Dubbed the Brick Tide, it survived its maiden voyage across Sydney Harbour—barely. Researchers say it’s a breakthrough in modular design. Locals say it’s a miracle it didn’t sink. Either way, it’s proof that with enough blocks and blind confidence, anything is seaworthy. <a href="#" class="read-more">Read more…</a></p>

				<h3>Did You Know…?</h3>
				<p>One of the most important components of effective life-long learning is <em>play</em>. Learning a new skill (like Web development) should include a certain amount of play. Renowned children’s programming entertainer Mr. Rogers certainly knew about the value that play represented:</p>
				<!-- Quotation -->
				<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/fred_rogers_193081">
					<p>Play is often talked about as if it were a relief from serious learning. But for children, play <em>is</em> serious learning. Play is really the work of childhood. –Fred Rogers</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Take a little time every day to just <strong>play</strong> with technology – you’ll be surprised how much you learn.</p>
<!-- STEP 4: Surround the IMG element below with a pair of FIGURE tags -->

<!-- STEP 1: Insert an IMG element with the src attribute pointing to the image called "mini-figure" in the 'images' directory -->
<!-- STEP 2: Add an alt attribute with a short phrase that describes the image -->
<!-- STEP 3: Determine the native image dimensions (height and width) using your file system, and add a height and width attribute to the IMG element above with the appropriate values -->
<!-- STEP 5: Add a FIGCAPTION element below (but before you close the FIGURE element), and add the caption, "Mini figure by Vanja (Public Domain)" -->
